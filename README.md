# Submit-Form
Code an HTML and PHP Form Example using a specific REST API

This was from a client on Upwork. And I worked this for testing.
The following is the client's project description.

We require a basic coded example HTML POST form and any accompanying PHP / JAVASCRIPT code to error check and submit a basic form (5 - 6 text fields of parameters max length text , email format, phone number format, and parsing for rogue code of one fixed text variable, and two .pdf/.docx (no .zip)  uploaded files, do some minor error checking, and then securely submit field data and files via REST API to a known specific API that will be disclosed (with basic variable documentation and some assistance from the API team available) that uses a token for authentication, and then re-direct to a generic "success" landing page.   Our team would then integrate and test the form and API connection and further coordinate any needed corrections / adjustments on an hourly basis if needed.

You will work directly with an experienced web producer who acts as the client's consultant so no direct contact with the final client is required.  You may need to interact directly with the target API Team if needed (although we can also act as an intermediary).

Good command of English language and ability to respond during EST business hours is helpful but not absolutely necessary so long as response is pre-agreed.

Example references, experience and/or qualifications should be submitted.
